OpenTelemetry is an observability framework.
[OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) is a collection of tools,
APIs, and SDKs used to instrument, generate, collect, and export
telemetry data such as metrics, logs, and traces, for analysis in order
to understand your software’s performance and behavior.

For an introduction to OpenTelemetry, see the [OpenTelemetry website
docs](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/).

To learn how to instrument your R code, see [Getting
Started](https://otel.r-lib.org/reference/gettingstarted.html) in the
otel package.

To learn how to collect telemetry data from an instrumented R package or
project, see [Collecting Telemetry
Data](https://otelsdk.r-lib.org/reference/collecting.html).

For project status, installation instructions and more, read on.

## Features

- Lightweight packages. otel is a small R package without dependencies
  and compiled code. otelsdk needs a C++11 compiler and otel.
- Minimal performance impact when tracing is disabled. otel functions do
  not evaluate their arguments in this case.
- Zero-code instrumentation support. Add tracing to (some) functions of
  selected packages automatically.
- Configuration via environment variables.
- Minimal extra code. Add tracing to a function with a single extra
  function call.
- Production mode: otel functions do not crash your production app in
  production mode.
- Development mode: otel functions error early in development mode.

## The otel and otelsdk R packages

Use the [otel](https://github.com/r-lib/otel) package as a dependency if
you want to instrument your R package or project for OpenTelemetry.

Use the [otelsdk](https://github.com/r-lib/otelsdk) package to produce
OpenTelemetry output from an R package or project that was instrumented
with the otel package.

## Status

The current status of the major functional components for OpenTelemetry
R is as follows:

| *Traces*                                                                                      | *Metrics*                                                                                     | *Logs*                                                                                        |

## Version support

otel and otelsdk support R 3.6.0 and higher on Unix and R 4.2.0 or
higher on Windows.

## Installation

You can install the otel from CRAN:

``` r
install.packages("otelsdk")
```

### Compiling from source

To compile otelsdk from source, you need to install the protobuf library
first:

- On Windows install the correct version of
  [Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/).

- On Linux install the appropriate package from your distribution.

- On macOS, you can use CRAN’s [protobuf
  build](https://mac.r-project.org/bin/) or Homebrew. If you are using
  CRAN’s build, then you must uninstall or unlink Homebrew protobuf:

      brew unlink protobuf
